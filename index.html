    <h2>Registration now open for the 35th edition of the Gananoque <font
        size="-2">Conference of Environmental Science and Engineering.</font><br>
    </h2>
    The Gananoque conference is a student-based initiative to gather
    those who are currently conducting research in environmental science
    for their graduate thesis or undergraduate honours project. The
    conference provides an opportunity for students to practice their
    presentation skills, present their research in front of a larger
    audience, and to meet fellow peers to discuss their research in a
    relaxed environment. Students are invited to share preliminary
    results, experimental work plans, as well as more refined results
    and findings.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Some history behind the congress</b><br>
    <br>
    The Gananoque conference was first organised in 1984 by INRS-ETE
    (University of Quebec) and McMaster University. Gananoque, ON was
    chosen as the approximate central location between Hamilton and
    Quebec City. Over the intervening years, presentations have covered
    areas of environmental science, including aquatic sciences,
    biogeochemistry, geology, environmental engineering, and toxicology.
    Students from many universities, including McMaster, INRS-ETE,
    Laurentian, Laurier, Trent, Toronto, Clarkson, Windsor, Queens,
    Ottawa and McGill, have regularly attended the conference.
